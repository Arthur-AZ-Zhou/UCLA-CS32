The way the cells differ is that for stacks, the first one in is the last one out. That means that you can explore the depths of a certain part of a maze
and the stack will keep on adding coordinates that go deeper into certain parts of the maze, hence the depth-first search. However, queues behave like a 
sonar the way that it spreads out in the maze to find the destination coordinate, hence the first in first out. The cells that get popped are different
because for a queue each cell around the original one searches around its cells and then those cells searches around its. It doesn't concentrate on one cell
and searches the depths of that one cell's destination and instead cycles through all the cells around the initial cell before moving onto the next one.
